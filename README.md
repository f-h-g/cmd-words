cmd-words
===========

Spell words with the letters displayed. Words don't need to be made of adjacent letters. Use up all the letters to see your time. If you're fast enough, you'll make it
onto the high scores!

How to Start
---
```javascript
npm i cmd-words
cd node_modules/cmd-words
node main.js
```

Directions
---
Type a word, then press enter. If you don't have the letters for a word, or spell something that isn't a word, you can try again. The word list is the same as in Scrabble,
so no one letter words allowed. If you get stumped or want to exit, type the number 1, then enter. You can only make it onto the high scores if you use up all the letters,
so choose them wisely. The letter list is the same as in Scrabble, but each letter has a variation bound by its tile quantity. So expect around 100 letters per game.
